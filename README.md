## Hi, I'm Eleni ðŸ‘‹

I work best where structured thinking meets real dataâ€”whether that means improving existing tools, building something new, or finding the right approach for a messy problem.

I'm a recent MSc graduate in Bioinformatics with a background in Computer Science, and my interests span data science, machine learning, and applied bioinformatics. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve contributed to three hands-on industry roles:  
â€¢ As a machine learning intern, I built automated classification pipelines using AutoML tools and LLMs  
â€¢ As a student assistant, I supported protein annotation workflows and bioinformatics pipelines  
â€¢ For my thesis, I explored how ML techniques could improve antibodyâ€“antigen interface modeling

In parallel, I completed two technical research projects:  
â€¢ Built an R pipeline for SNP interaction modeling using linear mixed models and permutation testing  
â€¢ Developed a workflow in Python for ancestral allele inference and DFE modeling from sequence alignments and VCF data

Technically, Iâ€™ve worked with Python, R, SQL, AWS, and HPC environments, applying libraries and tools for statistical modeling, automation, and large-scale data analysis. I value clean code, reproducible workflows, and building things that are both useful and understandable.

Whether itâ€™s designing ML workflows, analyzing complex biological datasets, or creating tools that help others work more effectively, I enjoy working at the intersection of data, code, and real-world applications.
