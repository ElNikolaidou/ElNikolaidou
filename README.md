Hi, I'm Eleni 👋

I work best where structured thinking meets real data, improving tools, building new solutions, or bringing order to messy problems.

🎓 I’m a recent MSc graduate in Bioinformatics with a background in Computer Science. Over the past year, I’ve gained experience through 3 industry roles:
- **ML Intern** → Built a Python classification pipeline with text mining and AutoML, ensuring reproducibility through modular workflow design.  
- **Student Assistant** → Optimized biological data management by restructuring cloud resources into a queryable SQL system, accelerating retrieval.  
- **MSc Thesis** → Integrated machine learning approaches into an antibody design workflow, benchmarking predictive models and optimizing performance. Focused on data-driven evaluation, reproducibility, and practical application in computational biology. 

🛠️ Technical projects include:
- **[Epistasis Pipeline (R + targets)](https://github.com/ElNikolaidou/epistasis_sorghum_project)** → Reproducible workflow for SNP–SNP interaction modeling.  
- **Evolutionary Analysis Workflow** → Python-based ancestral allele inference and fitness effect modeling.

📚 Published code
- **Bayesian Meta-analysis in Stata** → Published research code archived on RePEc/IDEAS.

I enjoy building solutions that make biological data more accessible and reproducible, with results that others can reuse and build upon.
