Hi, I'm Eleni 👋

I work best where structured thinking meets real data, improving tools, building new solutions, or bringing order to messy problems.

🎓 I’m a recent MSc graduate in Bioinformatics with a background in Computer Science. Over the past year, I’ve gained experience through:
- **ML Intern** → Built a Python classification pipeline with text mining + AutoML, ensuring reproducibility through modular workflow design.  
- **Student Assistant** → Optimized biological data management by restructuring cloud resources into a queryable SQL system, accelerating retrieval.  
- **MSc Thesis** → Integrated ML into an antibody design pipeline, benchmarking docking vs. deep learning approaches to improve predictions.  

🛠️ Technical projects include:
- **[Epistasis Pipeline (R + targets)](https://github.com/ElNikolaidou/epistasis_sorghum_project)** → Reproducible workflow for SNP–SNP interaction modeling.  
- **Evolutionary Analysis Workflow** → Python-based ancestral allele inference and fitness effect modeling.  

I enjoy working at the intersection of data, code, and real-world biology, always aiming for clarity in logic, reproducibility in workflows, and impact in results.
